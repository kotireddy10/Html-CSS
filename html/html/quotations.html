            We collaborate with local communities to conserve the
            natural resources we all depend on and build a future
            in which people and nature thrive. Together with partners
            at all levels, we transform markets and policies toward
            sustainability, tackle the threats driving the climate 
            crisis, and protect and restore wildlife and their habitats.</blockquote>
